# ROBT 403 Lab Assignment 3 - Part 1
## Joint movement of the planar robot
**TASK:** Create a rosnode that will “listen” for std_msgs/Float64 type data and “publish” this data to the joint of the planar robot. The node should send the command to move if the any new incoming value is lower than the previous one.
